# Property Landing Page

This is one of my personal projects. I created this using [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/) & [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## How to use

First, clone this repository :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hendriam/property-landing-page-with-nextjs-tailwindcss.git
```

Second, go to directory :

```bash
cd /property-landing-page-with-nextjs-tailwindcss
```

Third, install dependencies :

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Fourth, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
